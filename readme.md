#### 2.2. Dart

##### 2.2.1. Variables

- Variables are used to store data.
- Variables can be initialized using the `=` operator.
- Variables can be declared and initialized in the same line.

```dart
String name = "Ahmed";
```

- Variables can be declared without initializing them.

```dart
String name;
```

- Variables can be initialized later.

```dart
name = "Ahmed";
```

##### 2.2.2. Data Types

- Dart is a strongly typed language.
- Dart has the following data types:
  - Numbers
    - int
    - double
  - Strings
  - Booleans
  - Lists
  - Maps
  - Runes
  - Symbols
- Dart also has the `dynamic` data type which can be used to store any type of data.
- Dart also has the `var` keyword which can be used to declare variables without specifying the data type.

##### 2.2.3. Error Handling

- Errors can be handled using try-catch blocks.
- The try block contains the code that might throw an error.
- The catch block contains the code that will be executed if an error is thrown.

```dart
try {
  // Code that might throw an error
} catch (e) {
  // Code that will be executed if an error is thrown
}
```

Here is an example:

```dart
try {
  int result = 12 ~/ 0;
  print(result);
} catch (e) {
  print("Error: Cannot divide by zero");
}
```

##### 2.2.4. Classes

- Classes are used to define objects.
- Classes can have properties and methods.
- Properties are variables that belong to the class.
- Methods are functions that belong to the class.
- Classes can have constructors.

```dart
class Person {
  String name;
  int age;

  Person({this.name, this.age});
}
```

- The `this` keyword is used to refer to the current instance of the class.
- The `this` keyword can be used to initialize properties in the constructor.

```dart
Person person = Person(name: "Ahmed", age: 20);
```

##### 2.2.5. Null Safety

- Null safety is a feature that was introduced in Dart 2.12.
- Null safety is used to prevent null reference errors.
- Null safety is enabled by default in Dart 2.12.

```dart
String name = "Ahmed";
```

- The above code will throw an error if the variable `name` is null.
- To allow a variable to be null, add a `?` after the data type.

```dart
String? name = "Ahmed";
```

- The above code will not throw an error if the variable `name` is null.
- To check if a variable is null, use the `==` operator.

```dart
if (name == null) {
  print("Name is null");
}
```

##### 2.2.6. Code Structuring and Formatting

- Code should be structured and formatted properly.
- Code should be divided into functions and classes.
- Functions and classes should be named properly.
- Functions and classes should be defined before they are used.

An example code structure is provided within the repository itself.

## Project Overview

Your project is to build a note taking app. The app should allow users to create, edit and delete notes. The app should also allow users to search for notes by title and content.

### Requirements

- The CLI (Command line interface) should display a menu with the following options:
  - Create a note
  - Edit a note
  - Delete a note
  - Search for a note
  - Exit
- All CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations should be performed within the CLI.
- The app should handle errors using try-catch blocks.
- The app should use classes and constructors.
- The app should use Dart's null safety feature.
- The app should follow proper code structuring and formatting.
- The app should be well documented.
- The app should be pushed to Github and a pull request should be created.
- The pull request title should be in the following format: `<your-name> - <project-name>`.
- The pull request description should contain the following:
  - A description of the changes made.
  - A screenshot of the app running in the terminal
